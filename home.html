    <h1><u>About me</u></h1>
    <p>I am currently in KCA University doing software development heading to my 3rd yea. The reason as to why am doing programming is because I had a passion of coding ever since I was little and I was exposed to a computer. I have been always in technology as nowadays it has been developing at a high rate which is slowly encourching to our daily life as people cannot survive without technology as provide the necessity to survive. So I developed a curiousty on how they work so I developed a passion for coding and now am doing my course and hoping to do my masters for Artificial intelligence.As the field will lead to a huge leap to technological development in a few years from now.</p>
